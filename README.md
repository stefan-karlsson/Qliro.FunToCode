## Interview Structure

### 📌 Preparations

- Read through this document carefully and make sure you understand what is expected of you before the interview.
- Clone the project and ensure you can run it locally, see [Getting Started](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for instructions. If you're unable to bring your own laptop, it's perfectly fine to use one of our computers on-site – just let your recruiter know in advance so we can arrange it.
- Review the codebase and write down:
  - What you think works well in the current implementation.
  - What you would have done differently and why.
- Feel free to prepare questions for the team – we want you to get a clear picture of what it's like to work with us.

If anything is unclear, don’t hesitate to reach out to your recruiter ahead of time.

### 🤝 What to Expect During the Meeting

#### 🗣️ Introduction (approx. 10 min)

You'll meet one or more developers from the team you’ve applied to. The meeting takes place at our office in Stockholm and begins with a brief introduction of everyone attending.

#### 💻 Coding Challenge (approx. 10 min)

Part of the interview involves a live coding session. It’s not about writing perfect code – we're more interested in understanding how you:

- Approach and solve problems
- Structure your code
- Reason about different solutions

You’ll be given a user story that describes a feature to implement in the existing codebase. It’s a practical task similar to what we work on daily – no tricky algorithm puzzles.

We know that live coding can be stressful, but our goal is for you to feel comfortable and able to show your strengths in a relaxed way.

You're free to use any tools or resources during the challenge – such as search engines, AI assistants, or any other references.

#### 💬 Reflection & Discussion (approx. 25 min)

After the coding session, we’ll review your solution together. We'll talk about:

- Your choices and thought process
- How you approached structure and design
- Your reflections on the codebase you reviewed before the interview

#### ❓ Questions for Us (approx. 15 min)

Lastly, you’ll have time to ask us any questions you might have. We want you to get the best possible understanding of Qliro, our team, and the role you’ve applied for.
